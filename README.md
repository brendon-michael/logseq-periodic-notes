# Periodic Notes for Logseq

Currently is very early stages.

My roadmap for releasing on the Logseq marketplace can view viewed [here](https://github.com/brendon-michael/logseq-periodic-notes/milestone/1)! **I plan on getting the first official release out around mid March. I have a few busy weeks coming up so development speed may be a little slow.**

Big thank you to [liamcain](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) for the inspiration with his work on Periodic Notes for Obsidian!
